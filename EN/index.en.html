        My name is Karolína, and I write about what’s happening in Perma Paradise. Since birth, I’ve been living with spinal muscular atrophy. It has given me some things and taken others away. And because the things we focus on tend to grow in our minds, the advantages grow for me!

        I think about possibilities, plan, and enjoy the process. The world, which isn’t tailor-made for me, shows me things hidden from others. It’s a gift because I can point out paths to society that would otherwise remain undiscovered. Right now, we’re heading down a dead-end road of the climate crisis.

        I believe that <b>diversity</b> is the driving force of change. Each of us has our own disability. (That doesn’t mean we are all the same—each of us has our specific needs.)
        Let’s embrace it and change the world so we feel like we truly belong in it. Belonging to the world means being heard and being able to participate. But most importantly, that we can be who we truly are.

        I have a little one, Saša. I want the best possible future for him. I want him to breathe clean air, be surrounded by many friends, and do meaningful work that he enjoys.
        I wish for him to live in a world full of biodiversity, with healthy landscapes, where work ensures a dignified life and people find purpose in what they do.
        In short, I want a good life for him, as described by <a class="intro_a-dark" href="https://www.tomashajzler.com/">Tomáš Hajzler</a>.

        We have been creating the Perma Paradise since 2018 together with Kamil, my husband. We both wanted a small garden. But it was only together that we gained the courage to take on a big and permaculture one :-). The first thing we did there was plant a walnut tree (you can see it in the photo from 2018).
        We strive to create everything responsibly and in harmony with nature. This is how we are building our house and shaping our garden. We aim to live as locally as possible — growing our own food, buying from local farmers, artisans, etc. In doing so, we support our region and our independence from global events. We want to live here together and with the local community.

            <p>A root treatment system is a great example of working in harmony with nature. A vertical root filter cleans our water, which we can then use for flushing the toilet or watering the garden.</p>

    <p class="intro_my_story">
        I've Always Been Drawn to Exploring the Human Soul and Psychology. Since childhood, I’ve been fascinated by the workings of the human soul, psychology, and interpersonal relationships. While I was drawn to nature and solitude, my disability kept me among people, making humans my primary subject of study.
        I pursued humanities in my education and became a teacher of social sciences, philosophy, and ethics. Fundamental questions like "How can one live responsibly?" "How can I be a better person?" and the timeless "Who am I?" have always been central to my thinking.
        I’ve struggled with how little emphasis these topics receive in education. I continually ask myself: What can I do to change this?
    </p>
    
    <p class="intro_my_story">
        I embarked on a journey to create my own work, and I write more about it
        <a class="intro_a-dark" href="https://www.permaraj.cz/blog/022_nova_prace/">here</a>.
        As part of this, I am answering these questions and striving to live them. Permaculture honors both nature and humanity, and I want to promote this.

    <p class="intro_my_story">
        I became a coach. It’s another step on my journey. A coach doesn’t give advice but asks questions, prompting the coachee to think.
        Through self-reflection, you discover new things about yourself. It’s often an adventurous journey within.
        What I enjoy most is helping people relearn how to say "NO."

            Permaculture is primarily based on ethical principles, as described by its founder, Bill Mollison, in his book Introduction to Permaculture.
            These principles are: Care for the Earth, which also leads to the next principle, Care for People.
            All of this requires a bit of our free time, money, and effort to support.
            We collaborate with nature in a way that benefits both nature and ourselves.

        <p class= "perma-container__left-author">Erazim Kohák</p>

        <p class= "perma-container__left-paragraph">
            This relationship between nature and humans is beautifully described by Erazim Kohák in his book The Fire and the Stars:
"When a person relinquishes their claim to be the master of nature, they gain, as if in exchange, their rightful place within it."

In permaculture, you don't control nature; you collaborate with it. Erazim Kohák did not explicitly align himself with this movement—at least, as far as we know. However, his attitude towards nature is similar, as he also emphasizes ethical principles:

"...we need to embrace humanity as a distinctly moral endeavor. Our task, then, is to cultivate the Earth as good stewards. It is precisely culture, in its most fundamental sense of cultivation, care, and respect, that can serve as a way to reclaim our rightful place in nature."

        <h3 class= "perma-container__left-title">Only in nature lies the complete guide to permaculture—no one else possesses it!</h3>

        <p class= "perma-container__left-paragraph">
            Do návodu se permakultura zredukovat nedá. Je to o neustálém objevování, zkoušení, empatii a pokoře.
            Do určité míry rozhodujete o tom, co si na zahradě vysadíte, ale také věnujete velkou pozornost a prostor rostlinám a živočichům, 
            kteří už na místě jsou a kterým se zde daří. Společně s nimi zahradu utváříte. 
            Největší mistr v zahradničení je příroda sama a vy máte možnost využíváte její sílu.
        </p>

        <h3 class= "perma-container__left-title">Be creative and make your work easier!</h3>

        <p class= "perma-container__left-paragraph"> 
            Permaculture cannot be reduced to a simple guide. It is about continuous discovery, experimentation, empathy, and humility.

To some extent, you decide what to plant in your garden, but you also pay great attention to and give space to the plants and animals already thriving there. Together, you shape the garden.

The greatest master of gardening is nature itself, and you have the opportunity to harness its power.
        </p>

        <h3 class= "perma-container__left-title">A good design is the foundation of a well-functioning garden.</h3>

        <p class= "perma-container__left-paragraph">
            Garden design is the foundation—it helps you create a space where individual elements are connected into a harmonious whole, 
            allowing the garden to function even without you! That’s the ideal.

            In reality, you’ll always be needed, but nature can take over part of the work for you. 
            So, make your work easier and join us in learning permaculture!

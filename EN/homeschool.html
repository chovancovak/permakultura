        I like wearing sweatpants, braids, learning new things, and I love people and nature. And I have all of this in my homeschool. It’s a place for meeting, discovering, overcoming, playing, creating, and also for understanding and relaxation.
    </p>

    <h3 class="domskola__h3">I’m inspired by children's energy!</h3>
    <p class="domskola-p">
        I try to tune into children's energy. I observe and discover what they are capable of diving into and sustaining. I then enrich these activities with educational elements. Movement engages different areas of the brain that support the learning process. This way, I successfully teach things like spelling, anatomy, geography, and more.

    </div>

    <p class="domskola-p">
        Children have a passion for adventures. We learn through making fires, climbing trees, running in nature, and on <a href="https://www.permaraj.cz/blog/036_domskola/\">expeditions!</a> Children are creative and love to create. This way, they can grasp the learning material with their hands. They have taught me how to learn through building—constructing mountains, rivers, volcanoes, ditches, castles, and more.
    </p>


    <p class="domskola-p">
        They have a desire to explore, they are active and energetic—that's what I love about them. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="domskola__h3">How can we best prepare children for a world that is yet to come?</h3>

    <p class="domskola-p">
        This is a fundamental question that most educators ask themselves. We around the homeschool have chosen homeschooling. We seek new paths while also respecting that others have chosen the conventional route. I think it’s great when multiple approaches to education develop, as they can enrich each other. If only one path is followed, we may find ourselves somewhere we don’t want to be.
    </p>

    <p class="domskola-p">
        What really encourages me in what I do are the children themselves. They progress, they are curious, proactive, they try hard, and they help me. Together, we have already overcome many challenges. This community of ours leads to growth and results. It’s also important to ask a crucial question:
    </p>

    <p class="domskola-p">
        <b>What kind of future should we prepare children for?</b> 
    </p>
    
    <p class="domskola-p">
        What skills will they need? The world is changing so fast that we have no idea what will be required. We need to raise children who can take action, who won’t wait for instructions but will take the initiative themselves. They will need confidence in their ability to handle different situations. In my opinion, it’s also essential that they learn how to find satisfaction (because even that is a skill to be learned) and how to be useful—being content and useful go hand in hand. They will need to collaborate, communicate, know themselves, solve problems, learn effectively, think critically, and so on.
    </p>
    
    <p class="domskola-p">
        A child who is proactive and curious has already won because they will naturally want to learn, understand, create, and explore. When someone is proactive, he/she is unstoppable. The paradox is that children are naturally like this, yet we often fail to see it—or worse, we suppress it. They are active and eager to learn, but they do it in ways different from what we expect, so we constantly interfere and say:
    </p>
    
    <p class="domskola-p">
        Now you will do this and that! (If they refuse, we call them lazy and uninterested.)  
        or  
        You want to do this and that? Then you must do it this way! (Under such "guidance," children often lose interest.)  
    </p>


    <p class="domskola-p">
        We often discourage children until they become completely discouraged. We create a resigned child.
    </p>

    <!-- třída z article -->
    <div class="ramecek">
        <p class="domskola-p">
            The inner desire to explore is a self-directed activity, but we turn an active child (who is capable of engaging themselves) into a passive one (who only responds to the program we create—essentially resigning). This inner drive is replaced by the engine of external motivation, where children learn either to please others or simply to avoid trouble. It’s a response to the reward-and-punishment approach to upbringing. </p>
        <p class="domskola-p">
            So how much freedom do children actually have?
        </p>

    <h3 class="domskola__h3">Warning! A independently thinking child!</h3>


    <p class="domskola-p">
        Of course, when we loosen the reins for children, they will set out on their own path and may even challenge our vision of the world. That might not be comfortable for us. But through this, they find themselves.
    </p>

    <h3 class="domskola__h3">Trust in children</h3>
    <p class="domskola-p">
        What I love building on the most is TRUST IN THE CHILD! As long as possible, I let them explore and struggle on their own—I simply observe and admire. The child is fully immersed in the process with their whole being. They are in a state of flow. Then comes the moment when they ask a question. That’s my time to step in—I support them, offer guidance, and at that moment, they truly listen!  </p>


    <p class="domskola-p">
        When I try to speed up the path to learning, we both end up struggling—the child and I. The child is no longer my partner but my opponent. I push knowledge onto them, and they might even try to listen, but no matter how much they want to, they can't fully engage in the learning process with their whole being. Learning cannot happen by command—not even by an internal command (I wrote about how much control we truly have over ourselves <a href="https://www.permaraj.cz/blog/027_jezdecaslon/\">here</a>).
     </p>


    <p class="domskola-p">
        Simply put, we intervene in the learning process far too often. It’s important to let things settle—and not just that, but to let them resonate. Too often, with the best intentions, we try to help the child by shortening their journey. We want them to avoid mistakes, so we tell them how to do things. This brings me to another crucial point that I strive to develop in our homeschool: Working with mistakes.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3 class="domskola__h3">Working with mistakes is the alpha and omega of growth</h3>
    <p class="domskola-p">
        "When we try to avoid making mistakes, it becomes very difficult. There’s anxiety and fear. When we make a mistake, in school, we risk punishment in the form of a worse grade. No one wants to make mistakes. Mistakes are associated with shame, unpleasant feelings…
    </p>

    <h3 class="domskola__h3">Let’s make mistakes!</h3>
    <p class="domskola-p">
        But when we change our approach to mistakes, we free ourselves. Imagine a world where making mistakes, getting things wrong, and being mistaken is something natural, accepted, and even welcomed. Instead of saying, 'You won’t succeed, don’t do it!' we would say, 'Give it a try and see!' Instead of saying, 'I told you so,' we would say, 'Great job trying!'
    </p>


    <p class="domskola-p">
        We really became aware of working with mistakes while building our house ourselves. I even wrote an article about it, <a href="https://www.permaraj.cz/blog/021_dum_stavi_nas/">The House Builds Us</a>. A lot of things didn’t go as planned, and it was dragging on, etc. We had to deal with it. This is something that happens in everyone’s life. Learning to turn mistakes, failures, and errors into something useful—that’s what will propel us miles ahead. We’ll get to places that grades in school could never take us. 'Learning from our own mistakes' is a well-known phrase, but what does it actually mean? We all know it, but how do you understand it? How do you apply it in life? Now, take a moment to think about it.
    </p>

        <p class="domskola-p"><b>Mistake and me – what happens there?</b></p>
        <p class="domskola-p">
            What do you experience? What happens when you make a mistake? Do you receive support or contempt from those around you? What do you do when you see someone make a mistake? Do you support them, or do you tell them what they should have done differently, essentially drowning them further?        </p>  
    </div>

    <h3 class="domskola__h3">Working with mistakes is a breakthrough</h3>

    <p class="domskola-p">
        Imagine a small child learning to walk. How many times do they fall before they succeed? Now imagine someone grading or commenting on them when they don’t succeed. There’s probably nothing more to add here. Perhaps would they have learned to walk after those same falls in the beginning? Or would they have simply given up, thinking they were a hopeless case… </p>

    <h3 class="domskola__h3">There is no such thing as a smart or dumb child.</h3>

    <p class="domskola-p">
        Since the beginning of September, I’ve been teaching once a week in the homeschool. When I first started, I wasn’t sure about the grade level for two of the children. At one point, I realized I didn’t actually know for sure. I thought about it. Do I need to know this? Yes, it’s a heretical question! This led me to think I should have information about other specific needs of the children, like whether anyone is dyslexic, etc. From my experience in the education system, I know that teachers need to know this. :-) But I came to the conclusion that such information can be detrimental (at least in my case). I’d end up starting to judge: 'You should already know this and that.' 'You are this and that.'
    </p>


    <p class="domskola-p">
        Without this knowledge, I have the opportunity to tune in to the child—where they are, what they feel, and what they need. During conversations and interactions with the children, I can attune to their current state. Of course, I often ask them and make sure. I assume that only they truly understand themselves. The learning process is based on the child’s internal needs, their intrinsic motivation. It might seem like it’s really easy for the children, but I would say the opposite is true. With me, they face many challenges. I don’t make things easier for them, and I don’t do things for them. I can also confront them when they cross my boundaries—the limits of what I can handle, both physically and mentally.
    </p>

    <p class="domskola-p">
        Specifically, it looks like this: if there’s a conflict, they need to resolve it and propose solutions. If they don’t want to do something, then what do we do about it? If someone is dissatisfied with something, it doesn’t mean that I have to come up with a solution, but I expect them to tell me how they would envision it.
    </p>


    <p class="domskola-p">
        When education is set up this way, there are no smart or dumb children. You have children at different stages of development. Our task is to grow and explore, but also to reflect, observe, rest when needed, and play. All of this together is learning.
    </p>

        <p class="domskola-p">
            I’d also like to stop for a moment at the topic of rest. Today, everyone, with tongues hanging out, says they are overwhelmed. People write emails at night, work, and handle unfinished tasks. Is this healthy? Does it benefit the body or cognitive functions? No. Do we want to teach this to our children? Maybe some people do. I don’t. Being able to calmly take a breath—that’s something I want to teach children. And myself. By the way, it significantly benefits cognitive functions. When we’re exhausted, we come up with nonsense and lose perspective.
        </p>  
    </div>


    <p class="domskola-p">
        When you label someone as smart, dumb, fast, slow, etc., it becomes definitive. You’re describing their whole being. A teacher friend once told me she set criteria by which she assessed students. One time she was grading a test for a student who always got bad grades. My friend was about to give her a lower grade again, but then she checked her criteria. Something didn’t align. She double-checked and, indeed, the lower grade she was about to give didn’t fit. This girl actually deserved a better grade this time, but if it weren’t for my friend’s awareness and preparedness, the prophecy of stupidity would have been fulfilled. And that would have happened twice. No one would have ever known about the teacher, though. He has a different label.
     </p>

    <p class="domskola-p">
        But how can we avoid this? We can simply assess individual activities, attempts, etc.

    <h3 class="domskola__h3">What would you see if you came</h3>
    <p class="domskola-p">
        You would see children running around the garden, jumping, looking for something, creating, cutting, writing, cleaning... shouting over each other, trying to manage conflicts... You would see them rejoice, play, but also frown or express their dissatisfaction in other ways. And that’s okay. My task is not to entertain the children, but to expose them to life :-).
